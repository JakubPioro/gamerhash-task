### Issues
* the lottie component is commented out in CardBig.Vue, I managed to put it in the right place, the animation partially works (not all graphics are loaded)

* i managed to create custom options, but after changing the selection, the view does not change and the value is not changed (probably a problem with z-index)

* component firstsection.vue Grouped image margin problem after applying transform
